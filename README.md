## My approach towards this project

In my React project, I engineered a hex map using SVG files sourced online, each hexagon's position defined within the SVG. By integrating these SVGs as React components, I assembled them to craft a dynamic world map. This approach, combining React's flexibility with SVG's precision, resulted in an immersive mapping experience within the project. Additionally, I addressed the graph component using the Google React Chart library, adhering closely to the design provided in Figma. This library facilitated the creation of the chart, ensuring alignment with the project's design specifications.
